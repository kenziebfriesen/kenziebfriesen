### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
ðŸ—£ I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Saskatchewan doing sports biomechanics research in the realm of injury prevention. I attempt to code to make life a little bit easier (sometimes harder). 
Currently I'm measuring shoulder motion of athletes, breast cancer survivors, and workers using optical motion capture Always happy to connect with other fellow researchers!
