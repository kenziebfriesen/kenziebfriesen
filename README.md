### Hi there ğŸ‘‹
ğŸ—£ I'm a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Calgary doing sports biomechanics research in the realm of injury prevention. I attempt to code to make life a little bit easier (sometimes harder). 
Currently I'm using instrumented mouthguards to assess head biomechanics. Always happy to connect with other fellow researchers!
